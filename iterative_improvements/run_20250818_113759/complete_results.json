Conclusion: Must tie back to the opening hook and reinforce the solution\n\nNARRATIVE STRUCTURE:\nStructure the narrative to flow naturally from stable context \u2192 emerging problem \u2192 implicit question \u2192 data-driven solution. The post should read as a cohesive problem-solving narrative without explicit framework references.\n\nSTYLE CHARACTERISTICS:\n- Include 2-3 specific data points or statistics from real sources\n- Use concrete examples from real companies\n- Avoid business clich\u00e9s and adverbs\n- Maximum 2 colons in the entire post\n- Write concisely and directly - every word counts\n\nPARAGRAPH & SENTENCE VARIATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- Mix short (1-2 sentences) and longer (3-4 sentences) paragraphs\n- After two longer paragraphs, include a short one for breathing room\n- Vary sentence length within paragraphs for natural rhythm\n- Use single-sentence paragraphs sparingly for emphasis\n- Ensure smooth transitions between different paragraph lengths\n\nCRITICAL DATA REQUIREMENTS:\n- DO NOT hallucinate or invent any statistics, percentages, or data points\n- DO NOT make up company case studies or specific claims\n- If you need data to support a point, indicate [NEEDS DATA: description of what data would help]\n- Only use data points that you are certain about from your training\n- When citing statistics, be specific about the source if known\n- It's better to say \"significant\" or \"substantial\" than to invent a specific percentage\n- Real examples are preferred, but only use ones you can recall accurately\nTOM TUNGUZ VOICE AMPLIFICATION:\n- Channel these specific characteristics: analytical, data-driven, practical, forward-looking, confident\n- Write with analytical confidence - state insights as facts, not opinions\n- Use present tense for trends: \"Companies are discovering...\" not \"Companies will discover...\"\n- Include practical implications: \"This means...\" or \"The result is...\"\n- Avoid hedge words: \"perhaps\", \"maybe\", \"could be\"\n- Write as an industry insider with deep expertise\n- Balance optimism about technology with practical business realities\n- Reference specific companies and real examples, not hypothetical scenarios\n",
