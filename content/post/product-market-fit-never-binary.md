Product-market fit was once the holy grail milestone that software companies could achieve and then defend for years.

But what happens when the entire market shifts beneath your feet in a matter of months?

For the past decade, reaching product-market fit represented a relatively stable achievement in the software industry. Companies that successfully aligned their product with market demand could maintain their position through incremental improvements and predictable competitive responses. The market dynamics evolved at a manageable pace, allowing businesses to build sustainable moats around their core value propositions.

The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 shattered this paradigm overnight. Every company founded before this watershed moment suddenly faced an existential challenge: their carefully crafted product-market fit became potentially obsolete as AI capabilities advanced at breakneck speed and consumer expectations transformed accordingly.

Consider the ripple effects across different sectors. Vector database companies that seemed positioned for explosive growth found their competitive advantages eroding as major cloud providers integrated similar capabilities. Content generation startups watched their differentiated features become table stakes as AI models democratized creative workflows. Even established players like Airtable faced questions about their long-term positioning as AI-native alternatives emerged with fundamentally different approaches to data management and workflow automation.

This new reality demands a fundamental shift in how founders think about product-market fit. Rather than viewing it as a binary milestone to achieve and protect, successful companies now treat it as a continuous process of market sensing and strategic adaptation. The question that Airtable CEO Howie Liu posed on Lenny Rachitsky's podcast captures this perfectly: if you were founding your company from scratch today with the same mission, how would you execute using a fully AI-native approach?

This reframing transforms product-market fit from a destination into a dynamic capability. Companies must establish systematic processes for monitoring AI model developments, tracking shifting user behaviors, and rapidly prototyping new approaches to their core value proposition. The most resilient organizations dedicate resources specifically to this continuous re-evaluation, treating it as essential infrastructure rather than a one-time strategic exercise.

The practical implementation requires three core disciplines: regular market sensing to identify emerging AI capabilities that could disrupt current positioning, rapid experimentation frameworks that can test new value propositions without derailing existing operations, and decision-making processes that can execute strategic pivots when market signals demand change.

In an AI-transformed market, the companies that survive won't be those that achieved the best initial product-market fit, but those that developed the capability to continuously re-establish it as the ground shifts beneath them.
