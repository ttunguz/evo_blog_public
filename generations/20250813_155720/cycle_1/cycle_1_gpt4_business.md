The slowest part of enterprise software isn’t the code—it’s the committee. Procurement cycles drag on for months, with stakeholders buried in demos, security reviews, and contract redlines. This friction costs startups precious deal velocity and leaves buyers frustrated. Now, AI agents are quietly compressing that timeline, turning months into weeks.

Software procurement is notorious for its inertia. Gartner has reported that B2B buying groups often take six to twelve months to make a major software decision. The culprit: complex requirements gathering, vendor comparisons, and compliance checks spread across siloed teams. AI agents promise to shrink these steps by automating the drudgery and surfacing insights instantly.

Take vendor shortlisting. AI-powered platforms like G2 and TrustRadius already use natural language processing to scan thousands of user reviews and summarize pros and cons. Where sourcing a shortlist once required a week of research, AI can now deliver a tailored vendor matrix in minutes. This isn’t just speed—it’s breadth. AI can absorb recent product updates, security incidents, and even pricing changes, presenting a dynamic picture that a human analyst would struggle to match.

Contract review is another bottleneck. Instead of legal teams poring over terms line by line, AI tools such as Ironclad and Lexion flag risk clauses, map them to company policies, and suggest redlines automatically.

Security due diligence, often the biggest drag, is also being rewritten. AI agents can cross-reference vendor security documentation with internal standards, flagging gaps and generating questions for vendors—tasks that previously required days of back-and-forth. Early adopters report substantial reductions in due diligence cycles. [NEEDS DATA: Case study from an enterprise using AI for vendor security assessments.]

The impact isn’t just theoretical. Microsoft has integrated Copilot into its procurement workflows, accelerating document analysis and vendor correspondence. Salesforce’s Einstein AI parses RFP responses, scoring them for fit based on historical deal success. The result: procurement teams spend less time chasing information and more time making decisions.

For founders, this means sales cycles could compress materially. Early-stage startups can focus less on navigating procurement bureaucracy and more on demonstrating product value. VCs, meanwhile, should look for startups leveraging AI in procurement tooling—speed in sales cycles is now a defendable advantage.

The transformation is still early. Regulatory compliance and nuanced negotiations remain human-driven for now. But as AI agents grow more capable, the balance will shift, and buying software may finally become as frictionless as using it.

If procurement can move at the speed of software, what new possibilities will emerge for enterprise innovation? The next big unlock for startups and buyers alike may be just a prompt away.
