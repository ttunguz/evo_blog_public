Managers are quietly taking on a new job: AI architect. This shift isn’t about mastering code. It’s about reimagining how teams and systems interact with machine intelligence—and then orchestrating the change.

A striking example unfolded at Goldman Sachs. The bank’s managers led a project to automate manual tasks in compliance, using machine learning models to sift millions of trades for anomalies. The result: significant reductions in time spent on routine reviews, freeing analysts for higher-value work. The lesson? AI’s value is unlocked not just by technologists, but by managers who redeploy human effort.

McKinsey has estimated that automation could raise global productivity growth by 0.8 to 1.4 percent annually. But the real bottleneck isn’t the models—it’s integrating them into daily workflows. Managers must redesign processes, define where AI adds value, and mitigate the risk of bias or error. They’re no longer just people leaders. They map out information flows, determine handoffs between humans and algorithms, and measure new bottlenecks.

The rise of generative AI makes this even more urgent. Companies like Morgan Stanley are piloting GPT-powered assistants to help wealth managers surface research faster. But these tools are only as good as the workflows built around them. If the right prompt isn’t integrated into the right part of the process, or if outputs aren’t checked, risk creeps in. Managers must ask: Where can AI make a real difference, and what level of oversight is essential?

A [NEEDS DATA: survey of managers’ comfort with AI-driven process changes] would likely show gaps in readiness. The best-performing startups empower managers to experiment and iterate quickly. At Stripe, for instance, operational leads play a central role in rolling out automation—from customer support bots to fraud detection—by owning the process changes, not just the technology.

This trend reshapes hiring and training. Job descriptions for line managers increasingly reference “AI fluency” or “automation experience.” Harvard Business Review has reported a surge in demand for leaders who can bridge technical and operational domains. Startups that ignore this shift risk building clever tools that never translate into productivity.

Investors should take note. A pitch about “AI-first” workflows is incomplete without a plan for manager enablement. Who will rewrite the standard operating procedures? How will frontline feedback shape the next product sprint? The winners won’t be those with the best models, but those whose managers become skilled AI architects, building resilient, adaptive systems.

The next question is clear: As AI becomes embedded everywhere, how will companies identify and empower these new architects—and what will they build next?
