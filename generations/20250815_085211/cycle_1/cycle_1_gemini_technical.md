The value of software is realized only upon deployment.

Why then do so many engineering teams treat shipping code as a high-stakes, infrequent event?

For years, the industry standard was the monolithic, scheduled release. Teams would bundle weeks or months of work into a single package. This created a high-ceremony deployment day, a fragile process fraught with risk and requiring extensive coordination. The accepted wisdom was that this was the cost of building robust software.

That model is now a competitive disadvantage. The market no longer waits for quarterly release cycles. Customer feedback loops are measured in days, not months, and the pressure to iterate is immense. The new challenge is not just managing the risk of a single large deployment, but the massive opportunity cost of not deploying with greater frequency.

This shift forces a fundamental question about engineering velocity and risk management. The 2021 DORA State of DevOps report provides a clear benchmark: elite performing teams deploy on-demand, often multiple times per day. Their change failure rate, the percentage of deployments causing a production failure, is under 15%. This is a stark contrast to low-performing teams who deploy between once per week and once per month with a
