Cursor, Replit, and a wave of AI coding tools have captured the imagination of developers and the wallets of investors.

But can a market built on negative margins survive the coming reckoning?

A few years ago, AI companies were a rounding error in software sales. Today, they are the story: according to Battery Ventures, 67% of all new software bookings this year are to AI firms, up from virtually zero just three years ago. Cursor claims a million users. Replit, by opening up AI-driven development environments at minimal cost, has grown at a pace that mirrors the early days of GitHub or Heroku. These companies have achieved mass distribution using the oldest play in the tech book—subsidize growth, win users, worry about profits later.

The trouble is, AI coding tools are burning through capital at a rate that even the cloud era never saw. The Information reports that Replit’s gross margins tumbled from 36% to -14% in a single year. Some users spend tens of thousands of dollars in model costs on $20 monthly plans. For certain products, gross margins now range from -10% to -200%, a level that would have been unthinkable for SaaS just a few years ago. Meanwhile, global AI infrastructure spending is estimated at $400 billion this year alone, with NVIDIA and the major clouds still unable to meet demand for GPU compute. The economics are upside down.

It’s hard to ignore the echoes of previous tech cycles. In the late 1990s, internet infrastructure companies laid fiber faster than customers could use it, leading to a bust. Now, data centers fill with GPUs, and the giants race to lock in supply. But for AI coding startups, the question isn’t whether infrastructure will matter long-term—it’s whether they can survive the short-term crunch. Venture capital can subsidize distribution for a time, but not forever. At some point, the cost of serving a single user must be less than the revenue that user brings in, or the music stops.

There’s a path forward, but it requires a playbook shift. Cognition, the company behind the AI coding agent Devin, pivoted early from targeting individual developers to landing enterprise contracts. By offering enterprise-grade solutions that deliver real productivity gains, they unlocked customers willing to pay thousands per month per seat. Consumer plans, meanwhile, get usage caps at sustainable price points—most often around $20 to $50 per month. This approach matches the value delivered to the price paid, while protecting margins. The lesson: companies that build for enterprise needs and negotiate contracts that reflect their true impact stand a chance to thrive.

Transitioning to this model is not trivial. It demands ruthless focus on cost control, deep partnerships with enterprise buyers, and a willingness to say no to the least profitable users. It also requires timing. If a company waits too long, it risks burning through its cash runway before the business model shifts. Move too early, and it may not have the scale or product maturity to convince enterprises to sign up. The infrastructure boom will eventually slow, and as GPUs become less scarce, the companies with real, defensible value will be left standing.

AI coding tools are at an inflection point. The era of subsidized growth at any cost is ending. The companies that align pricing and value, cut unsustainable free usage, and prioritize enterprise relationships will not only survive the coming shakeout—they’ll define the next generation of software. For founders and investors, the lesson is clear: distribution is necessary, but without sustainable economics, it’s never enough.
