AI coding tools have captured millions of users through a familiar Silicon Valley playbook: subsidize everything and grab market share.

The economics behind this land grab reveal a troubling pattern that threatens the entire sector's future.

Three years ago, AI companies represented 0% of new software bookings. Today they command 67% of all new enterprise software purchases, creating a massive shift in how businesses buy technology. Companies like Cursor and Replit have built substantial user bases by offering powerful AI coding assistance at prices far below their true costs.

The unit economics paint a stark picture. [NEEDS DATA: Specific gross margin figures for major AI coding companies]. Some AI coding platforms operate with gross margins between -10% and -200%, meaning they lose money on every single user. Individual developers consume thousands of dollars in model costs while paying monthly subscriptions of $20 or less.

This creates an unsustainable feedback loop where growth accelerates losses rather than building toward profitability.

The critical question becomes whether these companies can transition from cash-burning user acquisition to sustainable business models before venture funding becomes scarce. The answer lies in successful execution of a two-tier strategy that captures value where it actually exists.

The winning approach requires splitting the market into distinct segments with different pricing structures. Consumer and small team plans need usage caps at $20-50 monthly price points that generate positive unit economics. Enterprise contracts must price according to the massive productivity gains these tools deliver - often thousands per month per developer.

Cognition demonstrates this model's potential. [NEEDS DATA: Specific revenue figures and timeline for Cognition's growth]. The company focused on high-value enterprise contracts rather than subsidized consumer adoption, building sustainable revenue from day one.

The transition challenge mirrors Docker's evolution from popular open-source tool to profitable enterprise platform. Success requires identifying which users generate real value and pricing accordingly, even if it means losing price-sensitive customers who never contributed to profitability anyway.

Current infrastructure spending of $400 billion this year alone suggests we're experiencing a classic boom-bust cycle similar to railroad or fiber optic buildouts. The massive GPU capacity being deployed will eventually find productive uses, but companies that survive the transition must prove they can generate returns on this infrastructure rather than simply consuming it at subsidized rates.

The land grab strategy that built today's user bases will give way to value capture models that separate sustainable businesses from venture-funded experiments.
