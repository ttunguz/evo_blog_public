AI coding assistants like Cursor and Replit have rewritten the rules of software distribution almost overnight.

But what happens when the price of distribution is a negative margin on every user?

. The strategy is familiar: subsidize growth, prioritize user acquisition, and worry about profits later. Cursor’s rapid climb to a million users mirrors the classic tech land-grab, echoing the playbooks of Dropbox and Slack. But the cost structure is different. Instead of server costs that scale predictably, AI infrastructure bills balloon with every prompt, inference, and model call—costs that even the largest cloud providers struggle to contain.

The cracks are already showing. . . One Anthropic user generated so much usage on a fixed plan that the company flagged the account. Venture capital can bankroll a negative margin for a while, especially in a market chasing a $400 billion infrastructure buildout, but these economics strain even the deepest pockets. In a world where the marginal cost of serving the most engaged user can eclipse their lifetime value by a factor of 10 or more, the old logic of subsidized scale breaks down.

Every founder and investor is now staring at the same inflection point. When distribution costs more than you ever recoup, does scale even help? If the GPU supply crunch persists and usage patterns remain unpredictable, how many of today’s breakout AI tools will survive the transition to sustainable business models?

Some leaders have started to carve a path forward. Cognition’s shift from a consumer tool to an enterprise solution stands out. By moving to tiered pricing—usage-capped consumer plans in the $20-$50 per month range and enterprise contracts in the thousands—they align revenue with value delivered. Enterprises are willing to pay for quantifiable productivity gains, justifying higher per-seat pricing and smoothing out usage spikes. The challenge is execution and timing. Move too soon, and competitors undercut you on price. Move too late, and you bleed too much capital to survive the transition.

The infrastructure cycle amplifies this tension. Massive GPU expansion echoes the fiber optic build-out: capital-intensive, overbuilt in the short term, but foundational for the next wave of innovation. . The companies that endure will be those that can translate infrastructure access into sticky, high-value enterprise contracts before the next funding window closes.

The AI coding boom rewards speed and scale, but the bill always comes due. Only those who can pivot from subsidized distribution to profitable, value-based pricing—before the capital tide turns—will still be standing at the next cycle. Founders and investors should act now, not wait for the market to force their hand.
