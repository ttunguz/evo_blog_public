SITUATION (Current Context): AI coding tools like Cursor and Replit have captured millions of users by offering heavily subsidized services, with AI companies now representing 67% of all new software bookings compared to 0% just three years ago. This land-grab strategy prioritizes distribution over profitability, similar to classic tech playbooks.

COMPLICATION (The Problem/Change): The unit economics are catastrophic: Replit's gross margins collapsed from 36% to -14%, while some tools operate at -10% to -200% gross margins with individual users consuming tens of thousands in model costs on low-priced plans. With $400 billion in AI infrastructure spending this year alone, the current venture-backed subsidy model is fundamentally unsustainable.

QUESTION (What This Raises): Can AI coding companies successfully transition from user acquisition at any cost to profitable business models before venture funding dries up, or will they become casualties of unsustainable unit economics?

ANSWER (Your Insight/Solution): The winners will likely follow Cognition's playbook‚Äîpivoting to enterprise-focused tiered pricing with usage-capped consumer plans (~$20-50/month) and high-value enterprise contracts ($1000s/month) that capture massive productivity gains. However, this transition requires exceptional execution and timing, as the current GPU infrastructure boom-bust cycle will eventually separate companies with real value propositions from those burning cash on distribution alone.

NARRATIVE FLOW: Flows from the current AI coding boom context, through the unsustainable economics reality, to the critical transition question, ending with a data-backed strategic framework for survival

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Structure your post to naturally flow through this SCQA progression
- Don't explicitly label the sections - weave them into natural prose
- The opening should establish the SITUATION
- Introduce the COMPLICATION as the central tension
- The QUESTION should be implicit (readers should feel it, not see it stated)
- The ANSWER should provide evidence-based insights and practical solutions
