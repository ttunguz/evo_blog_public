Good use of specific examples like GitHub Copilot and Cursor to illustrate points. | Weaknesses: Argument feels incomplete - cuts off mid-thought and lacks concrete evidence (author acknowledges missing data). The historical parallel is mentioned but underdeveloped. No clear resolution or actionable insights for readers."
