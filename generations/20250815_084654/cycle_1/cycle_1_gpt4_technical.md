Automation began with a simple premise: move data from point A to point B.

When did software stop being about plumbing and start being about trust?

For decades, the linchpin of automation was the ETL pipeline. Data engineers built robust systems to extract, transform, and load data, shuttling massive volumes between warehouses and applications. These pipelines created order from chaos and powered dashboards, reporting tools, and analytics products. The focus was reliability and scale—get the right data to the right place, on time.

But the landscape is changing. As generative AI enters the enterprise, the automation challenge morphs from structured data movement to orchestrating dynamic, multi-step decision processes. Instead of moving rows and columns, companies map complex workflows—sequences of AI-powered actions, human-in-the-loop approvals, and conditional logic. The goal becomes not just data integrity, but delivering outcomes people can trust. Tools like Airflow and dbt, once synonymous with automation, now compete with platforms like LangChain and Microsoft Copilot Studio, which enable teams to diagram, simulate, and refine AI-driven workflows.

The shift raises a critical question: how do teams build confidence in these new, more opaque processes? With ETL, errors were tangible and debuggable. With AI, the same workflow can yield different results each run. Users must trust not only the logic, but also the AI’s judgment. In a recent McKinsey survey, a significant number of business leaders cited lack of trust as the top barrier to AI adoption.

The answer starts with iteration. Instead of deploying monolithic workflows, leading teams deploy, measure, and refine. At GitHub, Copilot’s integration into developer workflows began with limited functionality, collecting feedback and error rates before expanding its scope. This incremental approach mirrors the early days of continuous integration: push, test, measure, repeat. Each cycle builds trust. Tools like OpenAI’s Evals and human review flows in Zapier point to a future where teams can A/B test AI agents, compare outputs, and tune them based on real-world feedback. Instead of static diagrams, automation becomes a living system—one that adapts until stakeholders believe in its outcomes.

This iterative, workflow-centric approach also unlocks a new kind of transparency. Rather than accept AI decisions as black boxes, teams use visual diagrams to surface each step, document decision points, and highlight where human intervention matters. This transparency is vital when business stakes are high. For example, in healthcare automation, every AI recommendation must be auditable and explainable. [NEEDS DATA: Example of healthcare company using workflow diagramming for explainability.] In this environment, trust is not a feature—it is the product.

Automation’s evolution from data movement to AI workflow diagramming signals a profound shift in how software creates value. Where once the goal was speed and scale, today it is confidence and iteration. Founders and investors who embrace this shift—by investing in tools and processes that make AI workflows transparent, testable, and improvable—will build companies people rely on, not just systems that move data. In the end, trust is the only automation that matters.
