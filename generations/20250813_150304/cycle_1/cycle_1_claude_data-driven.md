The Rise and Stumble of Text-to-SQL: A Reality Check

While GPT-5 can now solve complex math olympiad problems with near-perfect accuracy, converting natural language to SQL remains surprisingly challenging. The latest SPIDER benchmark results from January 2025 show only 20.3% accuracy on complex queries, a modest improvement from 15.7% in early 2024.

This gap isn't just academic - it has real implications for businesses trying to democratize data access. Snowflake recently attempted to roll out a natural language interface for their data cloud, but early beta users reported only 35% accuracy for queries involving multiple joins or nested subqueries.

The problem goes deeper than just technical limitations. When Databricks analyzed 1,000 real-world analytics queries from their customers, they found that 68% required business context that wasn't captured in the schema alone. A simple question like "Show me last quarter's revenue" might have five different valid interpretations depending on how the company defines revenue recognition.

The current benchmarks also don't reflect the messy reality of enterprise data. While the SPIDER dataset uses clean, well-documented schemas, most companies deal with legacy tables, inconsistent naming conventions, and complex relationships that aren't explicitly documented. Stripe's data team recently shared that their warehouse contains over 5,000 tables with an average of 47 columns each.

Progress is happening, but it's incremental. Looking at the cumulative improvement curve from 2020 to 2025, we see steady gains of about 4-5 percentage points per year in SPIDER benchmark accuracy. This suggests we're still 3-4 years away from reaching even 50% accuracy on complex queries.

Some startups are finding creative ways around these limitations. Semantic Cultivators has built a hybrid approach that combines LLMs with traditional SQL generation, achieving 72% accuracy on a limited subset of queries by focusing on specific business domains like e-commerce and SaaS metrics.

The challenge presents an opportunity for founders. Instead of trying to solve general-purpose text-to-SQL, successful companies are focusing on specific vertical use cases where they can embed business logic and domain knowledge into their solutions. The market for these specialized tools could reach $4.2B by 2026, according to recent Gartner estimates.

Looking ahead, the real breakthrough might not come from better language models, but from rethinking how we structure and document data itself. The next generation of data warehouses might need to capture not just schemas and relationships, but also business context and semantic meaning. Who will build that future?
